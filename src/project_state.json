  "summary": "Project has expanded from x39Matrix.org minimal rebrand into a full X39Matrix token portal: canonical domain intended to be x39matrix.org (with x39dark.com as satellite 301 redirect), prominent triangular logo branding, multilingual messaging, airdrop/claim UX with wallet selector + manual address entry, token launch messaging/scheduling (now targeting March 15, 2026 with legal disclaimer), optional NNS-like staking/governance surfaces and market analytics panels; ongoing major blocker is custom-domain DNS/SSL resolution for x39matrix.org.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Frontend is a React SPA (TypeScript) styled with Tailwind CSS + custom cyberpunk animation utilities (neon glow, triangle pulse, mist float) and uses lucide-react icons extensively.",
    "Uses @tanstack/react-query for data fetching/caching; actor creation is identity-aware and triggers dependent query invalidation/refetch on identity changes.",
    "Authentication uses DFINITY Internet Identity via @dfinity/auth-client, exposed through a React context provider (login/logout, persisted identity, 30-day TTL).",
    "ICP canister interaction follows the actor pattern: an anonymous actor is used when unauthenticated; an authenticated actor is created with identity and runs an initialization step (initializeAccessControl).",
    "3D rendering is used in multiple places: a Three.js canvas background (HolographicHero) and a React Three Fiber mini-game (X39ICPGame).",
    "QR utilities rely on dynamically loaded external CDN scripts (qrcodejs for generation and jsQR for scanning) with retry/fallback logic.",
    "Backend is a single Motoko actor composed from modules: authorization/access-control, stripe integration, HTTP outcall helper, and blob-storage mixin; authorization is role-based (#admin/#user/#guest).",
    "Backend HTTP calls to Stripe use IC management canister http_request with a transform function to strip headers, and attach cycles explicitly per request.",
    "A shadcn/ui-style component library scaffold has been added (via build-template), providing reusable UI primitives and associated frontend tooling/configuration.",
    "Repository now includes a build-template for standardized ICP deployments (Dockerfile, deploy.sh, canister.yaml files, workspace/package setup) and build utility scripts (prune-unused-images, resize-images)."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "ICPPaymentGate describes automatic unlocking after payment, but no payment verification/unlock mechanism is implemented in the frontend (and no matching backend logic is present in the provided code).",
    "Several UI panels use mock/generated data (TokenAnalyticsPanel, PerformanceMetricsDashboard, DailyNewsUpdates, token counters), indicating missing real backend integrations.",
    "Hard-coded reliance on Binance public APIs may fail in some environments due to rate limits, regional blocks, or CORS/network restrictions.",
    "AccessControl assigns the first non-anonymous principal calling initializeAccessControl() as admin; there is no recovery/rotation mechanism if that principal is lost or never initializes.",
    "Blob storage module requires the CAFFFEINE_STORAGE_CASHIER_PRINCIPAL environment variable; canister traps if missing.",
    "Custom domain (x39matrix.com / x39.org) intermittently fails to resolve to the ICP canister and may show a default Nginx page, indicating DNS/SSL/canister domain-mapping misconfiguration or incomplete propagation.",
    "Countdown/launch-timer logic has been unstable and was requested to be removed or replaced to avoid credibility issues.",
    "x39matrix.com domain access reported as failing/not opening; indicates ongoing DNS/SSL/custom-domain-to-canister mapping issues similar to prior x39dark.com problems.",
    "Deployment failures/guard blocks occurred during publish attempts; draft expirations repeatedly interrupted releases.",
    "Requested prominent launch/countdown block on x39dark.com may conflict with the canonical-domain plan (x39matrix.org primary with x39dark.com 301 redirect), requiring a clarified redirect/content strategy."
