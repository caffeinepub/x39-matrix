  "architecturalNotes": [
    "Frontend is a React SPA (TypeScript) styled with Tailwind CSS + custom cyberpunk animation utilities (neon glow, triangle pulse, mist float) and uses lucide-react icons extensively.",
    "Uses @tanstack/react-query for data fetching/caching; actor creation is identity-aware and triggers dependent query invalidation/refetch on identity changes.",
    "Authentication uses DFINITY Internet Identity via @dfinity/auth-client, exposed through a React context provider (login/logout, persisted identity, 30-day TTL).",
    "ICP canister interaction follows the actor pattern: an anonymous actor is used when unauthenticated; an authenticated actor is created with identity and runs an initialization step (initializeAccessControl).",
    "3D rendering is used in multiple places: a Three.js canvas background (HolographicHero) and a React Three Fiber mini-game (X39ICPGame).",
    "QR utilities rely on dynamically loaded external CDN scripts (qrcodejs for generation and jsQR for scanning) with retry/fallback logic.",
    "Backend is a single Motoko actor composed from modules: authorization/access-control, stripe integration, HTTP outcall helper, and blob-storage mixin; authorization is role-based (#admin/#user/#guest).",
    "Backend HTTP calls to Stripe use IC management canister http_request with a transform function to strip headers, and attach cycles explicitly per request.",
    "A shadcn/ui-style component library scaffold has been added (via build-template), providing reusable UI primitives and associated frontend tooling/configuration.",
    "Repository now includes a build-template for standardized ICP deployments (Dockerfile, deploy.sh, canister.yaml files, workspace/package setup) and build utility scripts (prune-unused-images, resize-images).",
    "Frontend linting now includes custom ESLint rules specific to project patterns (e.g., enforcing InternetIdentityProvider usage and avoiding BigInt in React Query keys).",
    "Project undergoing domain/brand migration from x39dark.com to x39matrix.com; requires ICP canister custom-domain mapping and DNS/SSL setup for global availability.",
    "x39Matrix token marketing UI uses a single official triangular ‘eye’ logo as the token mark across all placements (header/token blocks/favicon).",
    "Airdrop claim UX includes wallet selection and manual wallet address entry by the user; avoid displaying any private/team allocation details publicly.",
    "Backend modules and build-template dependencies were updated to newer component versions (authorization v3.0.0, stripe v3.0.0, http-outcalls v3.0.0, blob-storage v4.0.0, core-infrastructure v1.0.2).",
    "Product direction now includes token utility surfaces beyond marketing: registration/airdrop claims, wallet linking, exchange price integration (MEXC), and an NNS-like staking/governance module for x39Matrix.",
    "Frontend now includes an NNS-like module area with portfolio shell/navigation plus separate stake/holdings and governance feature modules.",
    "Holdings and governance data access are implemented via dedicated React Query hooks (useHoldings/useProposals) to integrate with the existing identity-aware actor/query invalidation patterns.",
    "Authentication UX is extended with a dedicated login button component (components/auth/X39LoginButton) for gating the new modules behind Internet Identity.",
    "Added a frontend connectivity diagnostics hook/component to surface network/ICP access troubleshooting guidance to users.",
    "Planned expansion: deliver an NNS-style x39Matrix staking/governance portfolio UX gated by Internet Identity, targeting web plus native Android/iOS app packaging.",
    "Planned UX: claim/airdrop flow should prompt wallet type selection and manual wallet address entry before completing registration/claim.",
    "Branding requirement: triangle-with-eye artwork used previously (\"Oráculo de Davos\") is the canonical x39Matrix token logo and must be reused consistently (header/favicon/token blocks)."
  ],
  "knownIssues": [
    "ICPPaymentGate describes automatic unlocking after payment, but no payment verification/unlock mechanism is implemented in the frontend (and no matching backend logic is present in the provided code).",
    "Several UI panels use mock/generated data (TokenAnalyticsPanel, PerformanceMetricsDashboard, DailyNewsUpdates, token counters), indicating missing real backend integrations.",
    "Hard-coded reliance on Binance public APIs may fail in some environments due to rate limits, regional blocks, or CORS/network restrictions.",
    "AccessControl assigns the first non-anonymous principal calling initializeAccessControl() as admin; there is no recovery/rotation mechanism if that principal is lost or never initializes.",
    "Blob storage module requires the CAFFFEINE_STORAGE_CASHIER_PRINCIPAL environment variable; canister traps if missing.",
    "Custom domain (x39matrix.com / x39.org) intermittently fails to resolve to the ICP canister and may show a default Nginx page, indicating DNS/SSL/canister domain-mapping misconfiguration or incomplete propagation.",
    "Countdown/launch-timer logic has been unstable and was requested to be removed or replaced to avoid credibility issues.",
    "x39matrix.com domain access reported as failing/not opening; indicates ongoing DNS/SSL/custom-domain-to-canister mapping issues similar to prior x39dark.com problems.",
    "Users report x39matrix.com / x39Matrix.com not opening in browsers; indicates ongoing DNS/SSL/custom-domain-to-canister mapping problems beyond existing intermittent resolution issues.",
    "Frequent deploy/publish failures and draft expirations interrupt continuity; deployment process appears unreliable and may block changes from reaching production."
