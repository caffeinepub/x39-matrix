## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the X39 Matrix launch hero by adding a subtle Matrix-style falling “X39” background effect behind the horse visual and updating the horse artwork to have clearly visible glowing red eyes.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a lightweight “X39” text-rain background layer behind the horse in the right-side hero visual area, styled to match the IntroScreen vibe but less distracting, and respecting prefers-reduced-motion.
- Update the horse hero image asset to include distinct glowing red eyes and swap the hero to reference the updated static asset from `frontend/public/assets/generated`.

**User-visible outcome:** The launch hero shows a horse with clearly glowing red eyes and a subtle falling “X39” background effect behind it, without hurting readability, responsiveness, or performance.
