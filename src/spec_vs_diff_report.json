  "summary": "Diff implements several stability and palette updates (sky-blue accent utilities, countdown clamping, chart/RSI guards, static hero background reference), but evidence also shows addition/expansion of unrelated “Golumanji” game features and Spanish-only UI text in new/modified game components; code-horse asset integration is not evidenced in the provided hero diff excerpt.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-20",
      "requirement": "Launch hero must render both the background texture and the “horse made of light/code” image from static `/assets/generated/*` with no missing-asset console errors.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt for `X39MatrixLaunchHeroBlock` clearly references the background texture image, but no reference to the required code-horse image is shown in the provided truncated content, so implementation cannot be verified from evidence.",

        "frontend/src/components/X39MatrixLaunchHeroBlock.tsx (truncated)"

      "id": "REQ-21",
      "requirement": "User-facing strings touched by these fixes must be English-first and follow the existing translation approach (LanguageContext keys or consistent English literals), avoiding Spanish-only hardcoded strings.",
      "reason": "The diff summary indicates Spanish-language UI/dialogue was introduced/exists in multiple modified game-related components, which conflicts with the English-first constraint for touched strings.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (entries for `frontend/src/components/GameHUD.tsx` and `frontend/src/components/Comecoco.tsx` mention Spanish dialogue/interface)"

      "description": "Added/expanded an entire “Golumanji” game flow (main menu, character selection, mission briefing including new Chapter 7, 3D game world, HUD with dialogue, and a Pac-Man-like mini-game).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest scope is stabilization, palette unification, calculation correctness, and hero asset regressions; it explicitly lists “Adding new features beyond stabilization...” as a non-goal.",
