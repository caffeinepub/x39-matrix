  "summary": "REQ-17 appears implemented: ambient code-rain particle colors now alternate between sky-blue RGBA and red RGBA, and reduced-motion early-return remains. REQ-16 is only partially verifiable from the truncated hero diff: some green accents were changed to sky (e.g., sky gradients/text and sky glow), but the diff excerpt does not show the CTA gradient and supporting cards to confirm all green accents are removed while keeping the middle red card unchanged. Two additional files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json) were modified without being requested.",

      "requirement": "Update the X39 Matrix launch hero block so that all green-colored accents are replaced with a celestial sky blue color (including CTA gradient start and supporting cards), while keeping existing red accents unchanged.",
      "reason": "The hero block diff is truncated and does not include the CTA/button gradient classes nor the supporting cards section, so it cannot be confirmed that all green accents (including CTA gradient start and supporting cards) were updated and that no green remains throughout the hero.",
