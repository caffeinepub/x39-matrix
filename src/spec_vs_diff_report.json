  "summary": "Docs and release-note/versioning markdown files were added for store submission, and web branding references were updated to point at a generated app icon path. However, the diff summary does not show actual Android/iOS release build configuration changes (package IDs/versionCode/build number) nor creation of the required asset pack files under frontend/public/assets/generated. Several unrelated gameplay and UI features were modified/added that are outside the BuildRequest scope.",

      "reason": "While an Android submission guide file was added, the diff summary does not provide evidence of (a) a reproducible command that produces an AAB, (b) actual Android release versioning changes in build configuration (e.g., versionName/versionCode), or (c) explicit artifact output paths/instructions for locating the AAB.",

      "reason": "An iOS submission guide file was added, but the diff summary does not show a complete reproducible build/archive command sequence nor evidence of actual iOS version/build number updates in project config. The guide content is truncated before the key build/export steps, so IPA export instructions cannot be confirmed.",
